# Customer-Purchasing-Pattern-Study
### BA780 Data Analytics

Business Problem: The main purpose of this project is to find relationships between customers’ characteristics and the amount they spend at a retail store. To meet this goal, we will study customers’ purchasing patterns in various aspects such as marital status, income, education, etc, and create a customer persona. On top of that, we will evaluate the efficiency of marketing channels from deals to catalog, namely to see which channel would be the most effective to our main customers.

Data Source: This dataset was provided by Dr. Romero-Hernandex, a professor at UC Berkeley and Hult International Business School. We assume that the company, and the actual source of data, requested to be anonymous. https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data
